# Spring-test-webapp 

This is a test project i made to teach my self the Java Spring Framework following the 
"The Java Spring Tutorial: Learn Java's Popular Web Framework" course on udemy.com . 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

```
The version of Eclipse that it was used for the development is Eclipse Neon on MacOS Sierra 10.12.5
The version of the server used is Tomcat 7
```
### Installing
```
Install jdk ee 
Install eclipse ee 
Install Maven Integration for Eclipse 
Install Spring IDE 
 
Install Tomcat 7 
Install MySQL Community Edition (there is a database.sql file in the project)

### Import to Eclipse 

The project is ready to be imported to Eclipse environment without any problem.
In order to Run the application on local server (Tomcat 7) it is important to configure
context.xml file of the server, through Eclipse. A copy of my context.xml is also uploaded
in the project. In this file there are the configurations for the server to connect the App
with the DB. Keep in mind that it is IMPORTANT to change the user and the password fields to 
match your local DB (and the url field, if another name is used!)
